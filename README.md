# Azure Data Architecture Generator

This project aims to create a web application that helps users design Azure data architectures based on their specific requirements.

## Core Components

1.  **Frontend (UI/UX):** Provides an intuitive interface for users to specify their data architecture requirements.
2.  **Backend (Logic Engine):** Interprets user requirements and translates them into a suitable Azure data architecture.
3.  **Metadata Store:** Stores all relevant information for the application's operation and user-generated content.
4.  **Diagram Generation Module:** Creates a textual representation of the proposed Azure architecture.
5.  **(Future) Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Generation Module:** Generates deployment scripts for the proposed Azure architecture.
