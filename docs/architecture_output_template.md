## 4. High-Level Setup Steps
<!-- HIGH_LEVEL_SETUP_STEPS_START -->
1.  **Provision Core Infrastructure:**
    *   Create a Resource Group in Azure: `[Resource Group Name]` in `[Azure Region]`.
    *   Set up networking (VNet, subnets, NSGs) as required: `[Networking Details/Considerations]`.
2.  **Deploy Data Storage:**
    *   Provision `[Storage Service 1 Name]` (`[Storage Service 1 Type]`) with the following considerations: `[Key Configuration Notes for Storage Service 1]`.
    *   (If applicable) Provision `[Storage Service 2 Name]` (`[Storage Service 2 Type]`) with considerations: `[Key Configuration Notes for Storage Service 2]`.
3.  **Set Up Data Ingestion:**
    *   Deploy and configure `[Ingestion Service 1 Name]` to connect to `[Data Sources]` and load data into `[Target Storage/Processing Service]`. Key settings: `[Key Configuration Notes for Ingestion Service 1]`.
    *   (If applicable) Deploy and configure `[Ingestion Service 2 Name]`.
4.  **Configure Data Processing:**
    *   Set up `[Processing Service 1 Name]` for transformations. Notebooks/scripts to be developed: `[Processing Logic Summary]`. Key settings: `[Key Configuration Notes for Processing Service 1]`.
    *   (If applicable) Set up `[Processing Service 2 Name]`.
5.  **Deploy Analytical Layer:**
    *   Provision and configure `[Analytics Service 1 Name]`. Load processed data from `[Source for Analytics Layer]`. Key settings: `[Key Configuration Notes for Analytics Service 1]`.
6.  **Develop Visualizations:**
    *   Connect `[Visualization Service 1 Name]` to `[Analytics Service 1 Name]`. Develop reports and dashboards for `[Target Audience/Reports]`.

## 6. Next Steps & Considerations
<!-- NEXT_STEPS_CONSIDERATIONS_START -->
*   **Detailed Configuration:** Each Azure service listed will require further detailed configuration based on specific performance, security, and cost requirements. Refer to official Azure documentation.
*   **Security:** Implement robust security measures, including identity management (Azure AD), network security (NSGs, Private Endpoints), data encryption (at rest and in transit), and secrets management (Azure Key Vault). `[Specific Security Recommendations]`
*   **Monitoring & Logging:** Configure Azure Monitor and Log Analytics for all services to track performance, diagnose issues, and set up alerts. `[Specific Monitoring Recommendations]`
*   **Cost Management:** Regularly review Azure Cost Management to monitor and optimize spending. Select appropriate service tiers and utilize reservations or spot instances where applicable. `[Specific Cost Optimization Hints]`
*   **Data Governance:** Implement data governance practices using Microsoft Purview for data discovery, classification, and lineage tracking, especially if dealing with sensitive data.
*   **Scalability & Performance Testing:** Conduct thorough performance testing and plan for scalability based on expected data volume growth and query loads.
*   **IaC Development:** (Future) Utilize the generated IaC scripts for automated and repeatable deployments.
